# Telecom Customer Merger — ETL Pipeline Case Study Plan
### MySQL (Multi-Source) → PostgreSQL (Destination) | Streamcraft Execution Framework

---

## Overview

This case study models a real-world telecom consolidation where four acquired companies — **Vodafone, Idea, Tata Docomo, Aircel** — each with their own MySQL databases, are migrated into a unified destination Postgres database (Airtel / Jio or both). The pipeline is built on top of the Streamcraft Execution framework and is designed to demonstrate every major ETL scenario at enterprise scale.

---

## Part 1 — Source Architecture (MySQL)

### 1.1 Source Databases
- 4 independent MySQL instances, one per company:
  - `vodafone_db`
  - `idea_db`
  - `tata_docomo_db`
  - `aircel_db`
- Each DB has its own schema, column naming conventions, data types, and quirks.

### 1.2 Sharding Strategy — Two-Tier Geographic Distribution

**Tier 1 — Zone-based sharding (5 zones):**
- North, South, East, West, Central

**Tier 2 — State-based sharding within each zone:**
- North: UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, HP, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, J&K, Delhi
- South: Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana
- East: West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Sikkim
- West: Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Goa
- Central: MP, Chhattisgarh

**Tier 3 — Table-level splitting within a shard:**
- Each shard table is capped at **1 million rows** (`SplitRowCap`)
- When a table grows beyond 1M rows, the seeder creates the next numbered split on the fly:
  - `customers_north_up_1`, `customers_north_up_2`, `customers_north_up_3` …
- `mysql_schema` only creates split `_1` at setup time; splits `_2`, `_3` … are created dynamically at seeding time (and by the source connector at ingest time in production)
- The pipeline connector handles querying across all splits for a given shard

### 1.3 Per-Company Sharding Strategy

Each acquired company used a different geographic organisation for its data before the merger.
Not all companies sharded by both zone and state — this divergence is intentional and exercises
the `GeoTagger` transformer which injects the missing geo dimension from pipeline context.

| Company | Sharding Type | Table name pattern | Geo columns present |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vodafone | Zone + State | `customers_north_up_1` | `zone`, `state` |
| Idea | Zone only | `customers_north_1` | `zone` only |
| Tata Docomo | State only | `customers_up_1` | `state` only |
| Aircel | Zone + State | `customers_north_up_1` | `zone`, `state` |

> **Why this matters for the ETL:** The `SchemaMapper` normalises column names; the `GeoTagger`
> fills in the missing geo dimension (e.g. injects `state` for Idea records, `zone` for Tata
> Docomo records) using the pipeline's shard context so the destination always has both fields.

### 1.4 Core Source Tables (per company, per shard)

Table name patterns vary by company sharding type (see §1.3). The `{geo}` placeholder represents
the zone, state, or zone+state key depending on the company.

- `customers_{geo}_{n}` — customer identity, PII, contact
- `subscriptions_{geo}_{n}` — active/historical plan enrollments
- `billing_accounts_{geo}_{n}` — billing cycle, dues, payment history
- `sim_inventory_{geo}_{n}` — SIM serial, IMSI, activation date
- `port_history_{geo}_{n}` — MNP in/out events

---

## Part 2 — ETL Pipeline Components

### 2.1 Transformations

Each pipeline applies a chain of transformers (matching the framework's `applyTransformations` function):

| Transformer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `SchemaMapper` | Normalize column names across sources → unified schema (e.g., `mob_no` / `contact` / `phone_number` → `msisdn`) |
| `TypeCaster` | MySQL `TINYINT` → Postgres `BOOLEAN`, `DATETIME` → `TIMESTAMPTZ`, `TEXT` → `VARCHAR(255)` etc. |
| `NullHandler` | Fill missing state codes, default null plan info, flag null DOBs for backlog |
| `PIIMasker` | Hash Aadhaar and PAN numbers using SHA-256 before write |
| `PlanMapper` | Look up source plan code → destination plan code via AuxDB `plan_mapping` table |
| `GeoTagger` | Inject `zone` and `state` as derived columns for destination partition routing |
| `DedupChecker` | Check `dedup_registry` in AuxDB for cross-source identity conflicts (same MSISDN across companies) |
| `UnitNormalizer` | Standardize data charges (MB → GB), currency formatting |

Transformers are composable and chainable. A failed transformer sends the record to Backlog with `FailureStageTransform`.

### 2.2 Checkpoints

Checkpoints fire after every committed destination batch. State saved per checkpoint:

- `source_company` — Vodafone / Idea / Tata Docomo / Aircel
- `zone` — North / South / East / West / Central
- `state` — e.g., UP, Tamil Nadu
- `table_split_index` — which numbered split table (1, 2, 3…)
- `last_processed_pk` — last primary key successfully written
- `batch_id` — batch sequence within this shard run
- `phase` — Extract / Transform / Load
- `timestamp` — wall clock of checkpoint

Checkpoint records are written to the **AuxDB** `pipeline_checkpoints` table. On resume, the pipeline connector reads the last checkpoint and begins extraction from `last_processed_pk + 1`.

**Shard-level independence:** Each zone+state pipeline has its own checkpoint row. North-UP can resume independently of South-TN without conflict.

**Table-split checkpoints:** If a state shard has multiple table splits, the checkpoint tracks which split is currently in-flight so resumption starts at the correct split.

### 2.3 Incident Backlog

Records that cannot be processed are routed to the **AuxDB** `backlog_records` table instead of failing the pipeline.

**Backlog triggers:**
- Hard transform failure — invalid MSISDN format, unresolvable plan code, unparseable date
- Destination write failure — constraint violation, duplicate key on destination
- Dedup conflict — same MSISDN found in two or more source companies, conflict resolution failed → both raw records go to backlog for manual review
- Schema mismatch — unexpected column from source, missing required field
- Null critical field — e.g., MSISDN is null (cannot route without it)

**Backlog record metadata:**
- `source_company`, `zone`, `state`, `table_split_index`
- `batch_id`, `checkpoint_id`
- `failure_stage` — Transform / Destination / Dedup
- `error_code`, `error_message`
- `raw_record` — full original record JSON
- `retry_count`, `created_at`, `last_attempted_at`
- `status` — PENDING / IN_RETRY / RESOLVED / ABANDONED

**Reprocessing:** Backlog records with `status = PENDING` can be re-injected into the pipeline as a dedicated reprocessing flow (separate Flow definition in `collection.json`) after root cause is fixed.

### 2.4 TerminateRule

The TerminateRule is registered as a control plane ticker that fires at a configurable interval (stored in AuxDB `terminate_rules` table). Conditions checked on each tick:

| Rule | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `ERROR_RATE_BREACH` | Backlog rate > 10% of batch records | Stop pipeline, preserve checkpoint |
| `SOURCE_UNREACHABLE` | Source MySQL connection error after N retries | Graceful stop, trigger Collection-level retry |
| `DESTINATION_SATURATION` | Destination write latency > threshold (ms) | Stop, alert, DestinationWriteTune slowify kicks in |
| `INTEGRITY_VIOLATION` | Critical field (MSISDN) null rate > 5% in batch | Stop, flag shard for source data review |
| `DUPLICATE_STORM` | Dedup conflict rate > 80% of batch | Stop, escalate to manual review |
| `IDLE_TIMEOUT` | No records received for > N seconds | Stop, assume source exhausted |
| `MANUAL_KILL` | Operator sets `force_stop = true` in AuxDB config | Graceful stop at next checkpoint boundary |
| `MAX_RECORDS_REACHED` | Total records processed >= configured cap | Stop cleanly (useful for incremental runs) |

Rules are stored in AuxDB and tunable at runtime without code changes.

### 2.5 DestinationWriteTune

The DestinationWriteTune is registered as a separate control plane ticker. It dynamically adjusts the destination write batch size based on current pipeline health metrics.

**Speedify mode (bulk load / off-peak):**
- Increase batch size (e.g., 5000 records/commit)
- Disable non-critical destination indexes temporarily
- Defer FK constraint checks to end of transaction
- Use Postgres `COPY`-style bulk insert via staging table
- Increase parallel write concurrency

**Slowify mode (production hours / destination under load):**
- Reduce batch size (e.g., 100 records/commit)
- Introduce deliberate inter-batch sleep (configurable ms)
- Reduce parallel write concurrency
- Activate connection pooling limits

**Config stored in AuxDB `write_tune_config`:**
- `batch_size_normal`, `batch_size_turbo`, `batch_size_throttle`
- `check_interval_seconds`
- `throttle_schedule` — time-of-day windows for automatic slowify (e.g., 09:00–22:00 IST)
- `destination_latency_threshold_ms`
- `concurrency_limit`

The `UserDefinedCheckFunc` in the `DestinationWriteTune` reads these config values from AuxDB on each tick and calls `SetDestinationWriteBatchSize` accordingly.

### 2.6 Auxiliary DB

A dedicated Postgres instance (or isolated database on the destination cluster) serves as the operational backbone of the ETL pipeline.

**Tables in AuxDB:**

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pipeline_checkpoints` | Checkpoint state per shard per phase |
| `backlog_records` | Failed/deferred records with full metadata |
| `dedup_registry` | Cross-source MSISDN → canonical customer ID map |
| `plan_mapping` | Source plan code → destination plan code lookup |
| `terminate_rules` | Configurable termination thresholds per pipeline |
| `write_tune_config` | Runtime-tunable batch size and concurrency settings |
| `reconciliation_log` | Post-migration row counts and checksums per shard |
| `audit_trail` | Before/after transformation snapshot per record (compliance) |
| `customer_merge_log` | Trace of dedup merge decisions (which source won, which lost) |

## Part 3 — Destination Architecture (PostgreSQL)

### 3.1 Schema Layers (4-layer promotion model)

```
raw schema        → Landing zone. Fast writes, no constraints. One table per source company.
staging schema    → Deduped, normalized, constraints applied. Conflict resolution happens here.
curated schema    → Golden records. Production-ready. The single source of truth.
audit schema      → Immutable append-only log of every change. Compliance and rollback.
```

Promotion from raw → staging → curated runs as independent async jobs, not blocking inbound write lanes.

### 3.2 Destination Partitioning

Postgres declarative partitioning mirrors source sharding:

```
customers (partitioned by zone)
  ├── customers_north (partitioned by state)
  │     ├── customers_north_up
  │     ├── customers_north_bihar
  │     └── ...
  ├── customers_south
  ├── customers_east
  ├── customers_west
  └── customers_central
```

Each state partition uses range partitioning on `batch_sequence_id` to mirror the 1M row split concept from source. This ensures parallel writers from different shards land in non-overlapping partitions with **zero write contention**.

### 3.3 Core Destination Tables (in `curated` schema)

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `customers` | Canonical identity — msisdn, name, DOB, Aadhaar hash, PAN hash, zone, state, source_company, canonical_id |
| `subscriptions` | Current and historical plan enrollments |
| `billing_accounts` | Billing cycles, outstanding dues, payment history |
| `sim_inventory` | SIM serial, IMSI, activation/deactivation dates |
| `port_history` | MNP in/out events — critical for merger continuity |
| `network_assignments` | Circle and tower assignment per customer |
| `customer_merge_log` | Full trace of cross-source record merges |

### 3.4 Write Safety Net

- All destination writes use `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` (upsert) — pipeline runs are fully idempotent
- Indexes built per partition AFTER bulk load, not during
- FK constraints deferred to end of transaction during bulk load
- Materialized views for analytics refreshed async — never block writes
- Staging table swap pattern: write to `raw`, validate in `staging`, atomic promotion to `curated`

## Part 4 — Orchestration Design (Streamcraft Framework Mapping)

### 4.1 Hierarchy

```
Collection  = The full Telecom Migration Job
  │
  ├── Flow  = {company}_{zone}   (4 companies × 5 zones = 20 Flows)
  │     e.g., vodafone_north, idea_south, tata_docomo_east ...
  │
  └── Pipeline = {state}         (6–9 pipelines per Flow)
        e.g., vodafone_north → up, bihar, jharkhand, hp, uttarakhand, punjab, haryana
```

Total pipelines at peak: **~20 flows × ~7 states avg = ~140 pipelines**

### 4.2 Execution Queue Design

The framework's `ExecutionQueueManager` manages:
- **FlowQueue** — all 20 flows enqueued at collection start
- **PipelineQueue** — flows are materialized into state pipelines on demand
- **RetryQueue** — failed pipelines re-enter here with exponential backoff or immediate retry per `RetryPolicy` config

Priority order: Retry → Pipeline → Materialize next Flow

### 4.3 Flow Orchestrator (to be implemented — PID: new)

Controls how many Flows (zone×company combos) execute concurrently.

```go
// FlowOrchestratorTune controls global flow-level concurrency
type FlowOrchestratorTune struct {
    MaxConcurrentFlows int   // e.g., 8 — limits MySQL source load
    FlowPriority       []string // e.g., run Vodafone flows before Aircel
}
```

This prevents overwhelming the 4 MySQL source servers simultaneously.

### 4.4 Pipeline Orchestrator (PID: 2 — to be implemented)

Controls how many Pipelines (state-level) run concurrently within a single Flow.

```go
// PipelineOrchestratorTune controls per-flow pipeline concurrency
type PipelineOrchestratorTune struct {
    MaxConcurrentPipelines int   // e.g., 3 states per zone at a time
    BatchSize              int   // initial destination write batch size
}
```

Config read from AuxDB `write_tune_config` at orchestration time.

### 4.5 Peak Parallelism Model

At full throttle:
```
8 concurrent Flows × 3 concurrent Pipelines per Flow = 24 active pipeline workers
+ 1 Aux write lane (checkpoints, backlogs, audit)
+ 1 Promotion job lane (raw → staging → curated)
+ 1 Reconciliation job lane (post-shard validation)
= ~27 concurrent goroutine lanes
```

Each lane writes to a non-overlapping Postgres partition — zero contention.

### 4.6 collection.json Structure (for this case study)

```json
{
  "flowOrchestratorDefinition": { "Name": "telecom_flow_orchestrator", "PID": 1 },
  "flowDefinition": [
    {
      "flow": { "pid": 1, "name": "vodafone_north" },

            { "name": "auxdb", "type": "postgres", "connectionParams": "..." }
          ]
        }
        // ... more state pipelines
      ]
    }
    // ... 19 more flows
  ]
}
```

## Part 5 — Step-by-Step Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1 — Infrastructure Setup

- [ ] **STEP-01** — Provision 4 MySQL source instances (one per company: Vodafone, Idea, Tata Docomo, Aircel)
- [ ] **STEP-02** — Design and create source schema for each company with per-company sharding strategy (zone+state / zone-only / state-only) and split naming convention (`customers_{geo}_1`). `mysql_schema` creates only split `_1`; subsequent splits are created dynamically when the 1M-row cap is hit.
- [ ] **STEP-03** — Seed source databases with realistic synthetic telecom data (customers, subscriptions, billing, SIM inventory, port history) — target 3–5M records per company. Use `--records-per-shard` flag; splits `_2`, `_3` … are auto-created by the seeder when `SplitRowCap` (1,000,000) is reached. Child tables (subscriptions, billing, sim, port) are seeded into the same split as their parent customer rows.
- [ ] **STEP-04** — Provision destination Postgres instance (Airtel / Jio)
- [ ] **STEP-05** — Create `raw`, `staging`, `curated`, `audit` schemas on destination Postgres
- [ ] **STEP-06** — Create destination tables with declarative partitioning (zone → state → batch range)
- [ ] **STEP-07** — Provision AuxDB Postgres instance and create all AuxDB tables (checkpoints, backlog, dedup_registry, plan_mapping, terminate_rules, write_tune_config, reconciliation_log, audit_trail, customer_merge_log)
- [ ] **STEP-08** — Seed AuxDB lookup tables: `plan_mapping` (all 4 source companies' plan codes → destination plan codes) and initial `terminate_rules` and `write_tune_config` rows

### Phase 2 — Connector Implementation

- [ ] **STEP-09** — Implement `IUseConnector` for each source company's MySQL (4 connectors) with support for querying split tables (`customers_{zone}_{state}_1`, `_2`, `_3` …) in sequence
- [ ] **STEP-10** — Implement state-level source isolation entities (one per state per zone — these are the pipeline's `sourceIsolationEntity`) that read from the correct shard table set
- [ ] **STEP-11** — Implement destination `IUseConnector` for Postgres targeting the `raw` schema with upsert (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`)
- [ ] **STEP-12** — Implement destination isolation entity for each partitioned table (routes records to the correct zone/state partition)

### Phase 3 — Transformer Chain

- [ ] **STEP-13** — Implement `SchemaMapper` transformer — normalize all source column names to unified destination schema per company
- [ ] **STEP-14** — Implement `TypeCaster` transformer — handle all MySQL → Postgres type conversions
- [ ] **STEP-15** — Implement `NullHandler` transformer — define rules for each nullable field (default, skip, backlog)
- [ ] **STEP-16** — Implement `PIIMasker` transformer — SHA-256 hash Aadhaar and PAN fields
- [ ] **STEP-17** — Implement `PlanMapper` transformer — look up `plan_mapping` table in AuxDB to resolve source plan codes
- [ ] **STEP-18** — Implement `GeoTagger` transformer — inject `zone` and `state` columns derived from the pipeline's shard context (passed via `TransformerProps`)
- [ ] **STEP-19** — Implement `DedupChecker` transformer — check AuxDB `dedup_registry` for MSISDN conflicts; resolve if possible, backlog if ambiguous
- [ ] **STEP-20** — Implement `UnitNormalizer` transformer — standardize data units and currency formats
- [ ] **STEP-21** — Wire transformer chain into pipeline `applyTransformations` (ordered: SchemaMapper → TypeCaster → NullHandler → PIIMasker → PlanMapper → GeoTagger → DedupChecker → UnitNormalizer)

### Phase 4 — Pipeline Control Plane

- [ ] **STEP-22** — Implement `Checkpoint` function — write shard state (company, zone, state, split index, last PK, batch ID, phase, timestamp) to AuxDB `pipeline_checkpoints`; implement resume logic in source connector to read last checkpoint and start from `last_processed_pk + 1`
- [ ] **STEP-23** — Implement `Backlog` function — write failed records with full metadata (source, stage, error code, raw record JSON, retry count) to AuxDB `backlog_records`; define `BacklogTune.Action` for each failure type (Continue / Stop)
- [ ] **STEP-24** — Implement `TerminateRule` — register all 8 termination conditions (error rate, source unreachable, destination saturation, integrity violation, duplicate storm, idle timeout, manual kill, max records); read thresholds from AuxDB `terminate_rules` on each tick
- [ ] **STEP-25** — Implement `DestinationWriteTune` — `UserDefinedCheckFunc` reads `write_tune_config` from AuxDB on each tick; implements speedify (high batch size, index disable, bulk insert) and slowify (low batch size, inter-batch sleep, concurrency cap) modes with time-of-day scheduling

### Phase 5 — Orchestration

- [ ] **STEP-26** — Implement `FlowOrchestrator` (new PID) — controls max concurrent flows globally; reads `max_concurrent_flows` from AuxDB; optionally enforces flow priority order (e.g., Vodafone before Aircel)
- [ ] **STEP-27** — Implement `PipelineOrchestrator` (PID: 2) — controls max concurrent pipelines per flow; reads `max_concurrent_pipelines` from AuxDB `write_tune_config`; returns `PipelineOrchestratorTune` array
- [ ] **STEP-28** — Build `collection.json` for the full telecom migration: 20 flows (4 companies × 5 zones), each with 6–9 state pipelines, correct connector PIDs, transformer PIDs, checkpoint/backlog/terminate PIDs, and AuxDB hub connections

### Phase 6 — Destination Promotion Jobs

- [ ] **STEP-29** — Implement `raw → staging` promotion job — dedup within raw, apply constraints, write conflict resolutions to `customer_merge_log`, insert clean records into staging
- [ ] **STEP-30** — Implement `staging → curated` promotion job — final validation, atomic swap into curated partition tables
- [ ] **STEP-31** — Implement audit trail writer — after each promotion, append before/after snapshot to `audit.audit_trail`
- [ ] **STEP-32** — Set up materialized views on `curated` schema for analytics queries (refresh async, do not block write lanes)

### Phase 7 — Backlog Reprocessing Flow

- [ ] **STEP-33** — Design and implement a dedicated reprocessing `Flow` definition that reads from AuxDB `backlog_records` (status = PENDING), re-runs through the transformer chain, and attempts destination write again
- [ ] **STEP-34** — Implement retry count enforcement and ABANDONED status for records exceeding `max_retry` threshold
- [ ] **STEP-35** — Add backlog reprocessing flow to `collection.json` as a separate flow that can be triggered independently

### Phase 8 — Reconciliation & Validation

- [ ] **STEP-36** — Implement post-shard reconciliation: after each pipeline completes, count source records vs destination `raw` records for that shard; write result to AuxDB `reconciliation_log`
- [ ] **STEP-37** — Implement post-promotion reconciliation: count `curated` records vs source records per zone/state; flag discrepancies
- [ ] **STEP-38** — Implement checksum validation: compare hash of key fields (msisdn, plan_code, state) between source and curated for a sample set per shard

### Phase 9 — Observability

- [ ] **STEP-39** — Add structured logging (already in framework via `zap`) at all key events: shard start/end, checkpoint written, backlog routed, termination triggered, tune adjusted, flow completed
- [ ] **STEP-40** — Expose pipeline metrics (total records, backlog rate, checkpoint lag, destination write latency) — suitable for OpenTelemetry integration (framework has KAN-16 OTEL branch)
- [ ] **STEP-41** — Build a simple reconciliation dashboard query set against AuxDB tables to give a live view of migration progress per company, zone, and state

### Phase 10 — End-to-End Test Run

- [ ] **STEP-42** — Run a single pipeline in isolation (Vodafone → North → UP) as smoke test — validate checkpoint, backlog, transform, and destination write all work correctly
- [ ] **STEP-43** — Introduce intentional bad records (null MSISDN, invalid plan codes, duplicate MSISDNs across two companies) and verify backlog routing and dedup handling
- [ ] **STEP-44** — Test TerminateRule triggers — artificially breach error rate threshold and verify graceful stop + checkpoint preservation
- [ ] **STEP-45** — Test DestinationWriteTune — simulate off-peak (speedify) and peak hours (slowify) and verify batch size changes dynamically
- [ ] **STEP-46** — Run full parallel execution: all 20 flows, all ~140 pipelines — monitor queue throughput, destination partition health, AuxDB backlog volume
- [ ] **STEP-47** — Simulate mid-run failure: kill one pipeline mid-shard, verify checkpoint allows clean resume from last committed PK
- [ ] **STEP-48** — Run backlog reprocessing flow on all PENDING backlog records — verify resolution rate and ABANDONED count
- [ ] **STEP-49** — Run full reconciliation suite (STEP-36 to STEP-38) — verify source vs destination counts match within acceptable tolerance
- [ ] **STEP-50** — Final sign-off: all curated records validated, all checkpoints marked complete, reconciliation log clean, audit trail populated

## Part 11 — Live Metrics Monitor

### 11.1 Purpose

While the pipeline runs you need continuous visibility into whether records are actually moving from source to destination, whether the checkpoint is advancing, and whether the backlog is growing. The metrics watcher is a standalone Go program that polls AuxDB and the destination DB on a configurable interval and prints a live terminal dashboard until you press Ctrl+C.

### 11.2 What It Monitors

| Section | Data Source | What It Tells You |
|---|---|---|
| **Checkpoint progress** | `auxdb.pipeline_checkpoints` | Per-shard: last committed PK, records processed, delta since last tick (throughput) |
| **Active pipelines** | `auxdb.pipeline_checkpoints` | How many shards had a checkpoint written in the last 30 s — confirms goroutines are live |
| **Destination row counts** | `destination_db.raw.*` | How many rows have landed per table — validates source → destination flow |
| **Backlog summary** | `auxdb.backlog_records` | Count by status (PENDING / IN_RETRY / RESOLVED / ABANDONED) × failure stage (Transform / Destination) |
| **Backlog rate** | Both | `total_backlog / total_records_processed` — the key health signal; TerminateRule fires at >10% |
| **Write tune config** | `auxdb.write_tune_config` | Current Normal / Turbo / Throttle batch sizes — shows whether speedify or slowify is active |

### 11.3 Throughput Signal

The watcher tracks `records_processed` per shard key (`company|zone|state|split`) across ticks. The delta column in the checkpoint table shows how many records each shard committed since the previous poll. A shard showing `idle` for more than 2–3 consecutive ticks while still `IN_PROGRESS` status means either the source is slow, a TerminateRule has paused it, or the goroutine has exited unexpectedly.

### 11.4 Running It

```bash
go run ./cmd/metrics_watcher \
  --auxdb  "host=localhost port=5435 dbname=auxdb user=etl_user password=etl_pass sslmode=disable" \
  --destdb "host=localhost port=5434 dbname=destination_db user=etl_user password=etl_pass sslmode=disable" \
  --interval 5s
```

Flags:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--auxdb` | localhost:5435/auxdb | AuxDB Postgres connection string |
| `--destdb` | localhost:5434/destination_db | Destination DB connection string |
| `--interval` | `5s` | Poll interval — accepts Go duration syntax (5s, 10s, 1m) |

### 11.6 What to Watch For

| Signal | Threshold | Likely Cause |
|---|---|---|
| Backlog rate climbing | Approaching 10% | Transformer failures, plan code mismatches, dedup storms — check `failure_stage` breakdown |
| Shard `idle` for 3+ ticks | Any | TerminateRule triggered, source connection dropped, goroutine panic |
| Destination count stalled | Any | Destination write failures, `write_tune_config` set to Throttle, destination saturation |
| Active pipelines < expected | < flows × pipelines | Some goroutines exited — cross-check `status = COMPLETE` vs `IN_PROGRESS` in checkpoint table |
| Write tune Throttle active | Batch size = Throttle | Peak-hours slowify kicked in — normal if within scheduled window, abnormal otherwise |

### 11.7 Implementation Location

```
cases/case_1/
  cmd/
    metrics_watcher/
      main.go     ← standalone Go program, part of the case_1 module
```

No new dependencies — uses `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5` already in `go.mod`.

## Summary Reference

| Dimension | Detail |
|---|---|
| Source DBs | 4 MySQL instances (Vodafone, Idea, Tata Docomo, Aircel) |
| Sharding | Per-company: Zone+State (Vodafone, Aircel) / Zone-only (Idea) / State-only (Tata Docomo). Splits at 1M rows cap, created dynamically. |
| Total Flows | 20 (4 companies × 5 zones) |
| Total Pipelines | ~140 (avg 7 states per zone) |
| Peak Concurrency | 8 flows × 3 pipelines = 24 active workers |
| Transformers | 8 chained transformers per pipeline |
| Control Plane | TerminateRule + DestinationWriteTune (independent tickers) |
| Checkpoints | Per shard, per phase, per table split — resume from last PK |
| Backlog | AuxDB-backed, retryable, with failure stage metadata |
| Destination | Postgres with raw → staging → curated promotion model |
| Partitioning | Zone → State → Batch range (declarative, zero write contention) |
| AuxDB Tables | 9 operational tables (checkpoints, backlog, dedup, plan map, rules, config, audit, reconciliation, merge log) |
| Implementation Steps | 50 steps across 10 phases |
